# Overview of Action in Web Flow

Action refers to a core concept in Spring Web Flow that encapsulates a piece of business logic to be executed as part of a flow.

## Purpose of Action

Actions are typically used to perform tasks such as form submission handling, data validation, and invoking business services.

## Configuring Actions

In Spring Web Flow, actions can be configured declaratively within a flow definition, allowing for a clean separation of concerns between the flow logic and the business logic.

## Driving Flow Execution

Actions can return events that drive the flow execution forward, determining the next state or view to transition to based on the outcome of the action.

```java
	protected void initAction() {
		if (getValidator() != null) {
			if (getFormObjectClass() != null && !getValidator().supports(getFormObjectClass())) {

			// signature: public void ${validateMethodName}(${formObjectClass}, Errors)
			validateMethodInvoker = new DispatchMethodInvoker(getValidator(), getFormObjectClass(), Errors.class);
		}
