title: Getting Started with MVC View

# What is View

The `View` in the MVC framework is responsible for rendering the user interface. It takes the model data and presents it to the user in a specific format, typically HTML.

# How to Use View

In this project, the `AbstractMvcView` class serves as the base implementation for views in the Spring Web MVC Servlet framework. It integrates with the Spring MVC view to render the user interface.

# Components Managed by AbstractMvcView

The `AbstractMvcView` class manages various components such as the expression parser, conversion service, and validator to facilitate the rendering process. It also handles binding configurations and message code resolution for error handling.
