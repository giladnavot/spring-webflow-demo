# Core Overview

Core refers to the foundational, generic types that are usable by all other packages in the Web Flow framework. The <SwmToken path="spring-webflow/src/main/java/org/springframework/webflow/core/AnnotatedObject.java" pos="16:2:8" line-data="package org.springframework.webflow.core;">`org.springframework.webflow.core`</SwmToken> package contains essential classes and interfaces that provide the base functionality for the Web Flow system.

## Key Classes and Interfaces

One of the key classes in this package is <SwmToken path="spring-webflow/src/main/java/org/springframework/webflow/core/AnnotatedObject.java" pos="28:6:6" line-data="public abstract class AnnotatedObject implements Annotated {">`AnnotatedObject`</SwmToken>, which serves as a base class for all objects in the web flow system that support annotation using arbitrary properties. The <SwmToken path="spring-webflow/src/main/java/org/springframework/webflow/core/AnnotatedObject.java" pos="28:6:6" line-data="public abstract class AnnotatedObject implements Annotated {">`AnnotatedObject`</SwmToken> class ensures consistent configuration of properties for all annotated objects, making it a crucial part of the core functionality.

An example of the core functionality can be seen in the <SwmToken path="spring-webflow/src/main/java/org/springframework/webflow/core/AnnotatedObject.java" pos="28:6:6" line-data="public abstract class AnnotatedObject implements Annotated {">`AnnotatedObject`</SwmToken> class, which is used to support annotation using arbitrary properties.
