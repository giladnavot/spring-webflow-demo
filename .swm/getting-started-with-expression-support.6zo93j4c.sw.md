# Getting Started with Expression Support

Expression support in Spring Web Flow involves various helper classes and methods designed to facilitate the parsing and evaluation of expressions.

## Overview

The Expression package provides a range of classes that help in parsing and evaluating expressions. These classes are essential for handling dynamic content within the Spring Web Flow framework.

## Key Classes

Several key classes in the Expression package play a crucial role in expression support. These include `AbstractExpressionParser`, `CompositeStringExpression`, `LiteralExpression`, and `StaticExpression`.

The `AbstractExpressionParser` class serves as a base for parsing expressions with specific delimiters. It provides the foundational logic required for interpreting various types of expressions.

The `CompositeStringExpression` class evaluates multiple expressions to build a concatenated string. This is particularly useful when you need to combine several dynamic values into a single output.

The `LiteralExpression` class handles expressions that are static text. It ensures that the text remains unchanged during the evaluation process.

The `StaticExpression` class returns a fixed result on each evaluation. This is useful for scenarios where the expression's output should remain constant.
