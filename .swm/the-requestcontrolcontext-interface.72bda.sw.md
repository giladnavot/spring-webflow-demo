title: The RequestControlContext interface
---
This document will cover the interface <SwmToken path="spring-webflow/src/main/java/org/springframework/webflow/engine/RequestControlContext.java" pos="52:10:10" line-data="	 * @see State#enter(RequestControlContext)">`RequestControlContext`</SwmToken> in the Spring Web Flow project. We will cover:

1. What is <SwmToken path="spring-webflow/src/main/java/org/springframework/webflow/engine/RequestControlContext.java" pos="52:10:10" line-data="	 * @see State#enter(RequestControlContext)">`RequestControlContext`</SwmToken>
2. Variables and functions in <SwmToken path="spring-webflow/src/main/java/org/springframework/webflow/engine/RequestControlContext.java" pos="52:10:10" line-data="	 * @see State#enter(RequestControlContext)">`RequestControlContext`</SwmToken>

# What is <SwmToken path="spring-webflow/src/main/java/org/springframework/webflow/engine/RequestControlContext.java" pos="52:10:10" line-data="	 * @see State#enter(RequestControlContext)">`RequestControlContext`</SwmToken>

The <SwmToken path="spring-webflow/src/main/java/org/springframework/webflow/engine/RequestControlContext.java" pos="52:10:10" line-data="	 * @see State#enter(RequestControlContext)">`RequestControlContext`</SwmToken> interface in <SwmPath>[spring-webflow/â€¦/engine/RequestControlContext.java](spring-webflow/src/main/java/org/springframework/webflow/engine/RequestControlContext.java)</SwmPath> is a mutable control interface used to manipulate an ongoing flow execution in the context of one client request. It is primarily used internally by various flow artifacts when they are invoked. This interface acts as a facade for core definition constructs such as the central <SwmToken path="spring-webflow/src/main/java/org/springframework/webflow/engine/RequestControlContext.java" pos="88:6:6" line-data="	 * @see Flow#handleEvent(RequestControlContext)">`Flow`</SwmToken> and <SwmToken path="spring-webflow/src/main/java/org/springframework/webflow/engine/RequestControlContext.java" pos="50:11:11" line-data="	 * new state by the State type itself.">`State`</SwmToken> classes, abstracting away details about the runtime execution machine. Unlike <SwmToken path="spring-webflow/src/main/java/org/springframework/webflow/engine/RequestControlContext.java" pos="20:10:10" line-data="import org.springframework.webflow.execution.FlowExecutionContext;">`FlowExecutionContext`</SwmToken>, which provides information about a single flow execution (conversation) and is not local to a specific request, <SwmToken path="spring-webflow/src/main/java/org/springframework/webflow/engine/RequestControlContext.java" pos="52:10:10" line-data="	 * @see State#enter(RequestControlContext)">`RequestControlContext`</SwmToken> is request-specific and provides a control interface for manipulating exactly one flow execution locally from exactly one request.
