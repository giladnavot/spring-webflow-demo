# Overview of Conversation Implementation

The `impl` package in the `Conversation` module contains various implementation classes that support the conversation management functionality in Spring Web Flow. These classes provide concrete implementations for handling conversations, ensuring proper management and lifecycle of conversations within a session.

## Key Classes in the `impl` Package

Classes such as `ContainedConversation`, `ConversationContainer`, and `SimpleConversationId` are part of this package. Each of these classes plays a specific role in managing conversations.
